# UKN-BluePill-Valorant-2024

This repository contains an asset dump for the Bluepill Valorant Spoofer, featuring advanced techniques to bypass TPM, HVCI, and Secure Boot. These features allow users to spoof hardware information, bypassing Valorant's kernel-level anticheat systems.

Key Features: TPM Bypass: Circumvents Trusted Platform Module restrictions. HVCI Bypass: Bypasses Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity for system protection. Secure Boot Bypass: Disables Secure Boot for unsigned driver execution. Installation & Usage: Run VolumeID to set the correct identifiers. Reboot into UEFI with the startup.nsh script to activate spoofing. Main serial modification is likely handled by AMIDEWIN. Note: The EFI file used for spoofing is Bpg.efi. Further analysis may be required, but caution is advised due to potential threats from the developer.
